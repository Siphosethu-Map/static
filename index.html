        <main>
            <p>I am a 29 year old aspiring Software engineer. I am fairy new to Software Engineering
                even though my passion has always been in IT/Software. I am a sucker for learning new
                things, especially when it comes to Software. I am hugely motivated by my curiosity to
                learn.
            </p>
            <p> I've always wanted to ba an engineer of some sort, but an engineer in software has always
                called to me. My passion is solving things which would explain my N6/Diploma in 
                Mechanical engineering. Even when I branched out to Mechanical Engineering , software
                kept calling me. I am fascinated about how the back side of the internet, softwares and 
                websites work
